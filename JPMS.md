# The Java Platform Module System (JPMS)
- is a feature introduced in Java 9 that allows developers to create more modular applications and reduce dependency issues. It provides a way to define modules, which are self-contained units of code that encapsulate functionality and expose a defined interface.

## Here are some key features and benefits of using JPMS:

* Modularity: JPMS enables you to split your application into modules, allowing you to organize your codebase more effectively. Modules have explicit dependencies on other modules, which helps in managing the complexity of large applications.

* Encapsulation: Modules enforce encapsulation by allowing you to specify which packages are accessible to other modules. This provides better control over the visibility of code, reducing the risk of accidental dependencies.

* Dependency Management: JPMS helps to address dependency issues by explicitly declaring dependencies between modules. This allows the Java runtime to verify and resolve dependencies at compile time and runtime, reducing the chances of runtime errors due to missing or conflicting dependencies.

* Strong Encapsulation: JPMS introduces a concept called "strong encapsulation," which enforces stricter access controls. This prevents other modules from directly accessing internal implementation details, promoting better separation of concerns and reducing the impact of changes to internal implementation.

Now, let's consider some scenarios where you might want to use ***JPMS***:

* Large Applications: If you are developing a large-scale application, modularizing it using JPMS can help you organize the codebase into smaller, more manageable units. This can improve code readability, maintainability, and reusability.

* Dependency Management: If your application has complex dependencies, JPMS can help you manage them more effectively. By explicitly declaring dependencies between modules, you can easily identify and resolve any conflicts or missing dependencies.

* Library Development: If you are developing libraries or frameworks, JPMS can provide better control over the visibility of your code. You can expose only the necessary packages/interfaces to other modules, ensuring a clean and well-defined API.

### Here's a simple example to illustrate the usage of JPMS:

Suppose you have an application with two modules: com.example.module1 and com.example.module2. module1 provides some services, and module2 depends on module1 to consume those services.

To define these modules, you would create a module-info.java file in each module's source folder. For module1, the file would look like this:

```java
module com.example.module1 {
    exports com.example.services;
}
```
And for module2, the file would be:

```java
module com.example.module2 {
    requires com.example.module1;
}
```
In this example, ***module2*** explicitly declares a dependency on ***module1*** using the requires keyword. The exports keyword in module1 allows the com.example.services package to be accessible to other modules.

By using ***JPMS***, you can compile and package these modules separately, and the Java runtime will handle the resolution of dependencies during execution.

Overall, the Java Platform Module System (JPMS) brings modularity and better dependency management to Java applications, making them more robust, maintainable, and scalable.
