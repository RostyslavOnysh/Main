# JShell:
JShell is an interactive ***Read-Evaluate-Print Loop (REPL)*** tool introduced in ***Java 9***. It allows developers to execute Java code snippets and explore APIs interactively without the need for writing a complete Java program. 
 Some features of JShell include:
* Immediate feedback: JShell provides instant feedback as you type code snippets, allowing you to see the results immediately.
* Code exploration: You can experiment with APIs, test out language features, and quickly prototype ideas without the overhead of writing a full Java program.
* Multiline input: JShell supports multiline input, allowing you to write complex code constructs and statements.
* Tab completion: JShell provides tab completion for class names, method names, and variable names, which makes it easier to write code and explore available options.


# Process API improvements:
In Java 9, several improvements were made to the Process API to provide better control over operating system processes and facilitate interaction between Java processes and OS processes. Some features and improvements include:
Process handle: The Process API introduces a new ProcessHandle class that represents a native OS process. It provides methods to get information about processes, such as process ID, arguments, start time, and resource consumption.
Process information: The ProcessHandle.Info class provides additional information about a process, such as the command used to start the process and the user who started it.
Process control: The Process API now allows you to manage processes more effectively by providing methods to destroy processes, check if a process is alive, and get the exit code of a terminated process.
These improvements make it easier to monitor and manage external processes from within a Java application.

# HTTP/2 Client:
Java 9 introduced a new built-in HTTP client that supports the HTTP/2 protocol and provides a more efficient and modern API for making HTTP requests. Some features of the HTTP/2 Client include:
Asynchronous and synchronous requests: The HTTP/2 Client supports both synchronous and asynchronous request/response handling, allowing you to choose the approach that best fits your application's needs.
* Stream multiplexing: HTTP/2 enables the client to send multiple requests concurrently over a single connection, improving performance by reducing latency.
Request and response bodies: The HTTP/2 Client provides convenient methods for working with request and response bodies, including support for different content types and data serialization formats.
* Connection pooling: The client includes a connection pool that manages and reuses connections, reducing the overhead of establishing new connections for each request.
* WebSocket support: The HTTP/2 Client also supports WebSocket communication, allowing you to build real-time bidirectional communication between the client and server.
Here's a simple example of using the HTTP/2 Client to make a GET request:

```java
import java.net.URI;
import java.net.http.HttpClient;
import java.net.http.HttpRequest;
import java.net.http.HttpResponse;

public class HttpClientExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        HttpClient client = HttpClient.newHttpClient();

        HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
                .uri(new URI("https://api.example.com/data"))
                .GET()
                .build();

        HttpResponse<String> response = client.send(request, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString());

        System.out.println("Response code: " + response.statusCode());
        System.out.println("Response body: " + response.body());
    }
}
```
In this example, we create an instance of HttpClient, build a GET request with a specified URI, and then send the request using the client. Finally, we print the response code and body.

These features introduced in Java 9 (JShell, Process API improvements, and HTTP/2 Client) provide developers with more interactive, control, and efficient tools for Java development.
