# JDBC
is primarily designed for interacting with ***relational databases***, which follow a tabular data model. However, NoSQL databases, on the other hand, utilize various data models such as key-value, document, columnar, or graph, which differ significantly from the relational model. As a result, JDBC is not directly applicable for working with NoSQL databases.

That being said, some NoSQL databases provide their own specific APIs and drivers for interacting with them. These APIs are designed to leverage the unique features and capabilities of the respective NoSQL database. For example, MongoDB has its own Java driver, Cassandra has the DataStax Java driver, and Neo4j has its own Java driver for working with their respective databases.

So, while you cannot use JDBC directly with NoSQL databases, you can utilize the specific drivers and APIs provided by the NoSQL database vendors to interact with them programmatically from Java applications. These drivers often offer functionalities similar to those provided by JDBC, such as establishing connections, executing queries, and processing results, but they are tailored to the specific data model and features of the NoSQL database.

It's worth noting that each NoSQL database may have its own preferred approach and APIs for interacting with it, so it's essential to refer to the documentation and resources provided by the specific NoSQL database you intend to use.
