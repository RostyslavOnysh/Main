# Relational databases support various data types to store different kinds of data. The specific data types available may vary slightly depending on the database management system (DBMS) you are using, but here are some commonly supported data types:

* Integer: Used to store whole numbers (e.g., 1, 10, -5).

* Floating-point/Decimal: Used to store fractional or decimal numbers with a specified precision (e.g., 3.14, -0.5).

* Character/String: Used to store alphanumeric text or strings of variable length (e.g., "Hello", "John Doe").

* Boolean: Used to store true or false values.

* Date: Used to store dates without time components (e.g., 2023-06-20).

* Time: Used to store time values without date components (e.g., 15:30:00).

* Timestamp/Datetime: Used to store both date and time values (e.g., 2023-06-20 15:30:00).

* Binary: Used to store binary data, such as images or files.

* Enumerated Types: Some databases provide the ability to define custom enumerated types, allowing you to restrict the values a column can have to a predefined set.

* Array: Some databases also support array types, allowing you to store multiple values of the same data type in a single column.

These are just a few examples of commonly supported data types. Different databases might offer additional data types or variations on the types mentioned above. It's important to consult the documentation specific to your chosen database system to get a comprehensive list of supported data types and their specific properties and limitations.
