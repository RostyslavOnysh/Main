# Window Sliding Technique : 
is a computational technique that aims to reduce the use of nested loops and replace it with a single loop, thereby reducing the time complexity.


# Problem Statement
Let us first understand the problem before going further with its approach. The problem statement is as follows, find the largest sum of K consecutive entries, given an array of size N. Not sure if you get it? Donâ€™t worry we will understand this by taking an example.

Suppose that the following array is given to us and we are required to find 3 consecutive numbers in this array that give us the largest sum. So, k is equal to 3 in this case.

''' 
arr = [16, 12, 9, 19, 11, 8]
'''

Blocks containing three consecutive entries in the given array are [16, 12, 9], [12, 9, 19], [9, 19, 11], [19, 11, 8]. Now we calculate the sum of each block, the sum of each corresponding block is as follows: 37, 40, 39, 38. Out of all these calculated sums, the maximum sum is 40. Therefore, our output is 40.
