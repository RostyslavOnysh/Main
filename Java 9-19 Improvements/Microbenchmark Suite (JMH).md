# Microbenchmark Suite (JMH):
Java 12 introduced a new microbenchmarking framework called Java Microbenchmark Harness (JMH). JMH provides a set of tools and annotations to simplify the creation and execution of microbenchmarks, which are used to measure the performance of small code snippets. Some features of JMH include:
Benchmark annotations: JMH provides annotations such as @Benchmark, @Setup, @TearDown, and more, which allow you to mark methods as benchmarks, set up and tear down benchmark fixtures, and configure benchmark parameters.
* Automatic optimization: JMH takes care of many optimization issues that can affect benchmark results, such as dead code elimination, loop unrolling, and JIT compilation warm-up.
* Statistical analysis: JMH provides statistical analysis of benchmark results, including average time, throughput, and standard deviation, allowing you to make more informed performance decisions.
* Integration with build tools: JMH integrates with popular build tools like Maven and Gradle, making it easy to incorporate benchmark tests into your build process.
Here's a simple example of a JMH benchmark:

```java
import org.openjdk.jmh.annotations.*;

@State(Scope.Thread)
public class MyBenchmark {
    private int[] array;

    @Setup
    public void setup() {
        array = new int[1000000];
        // Initialize array with some values
    }

    @Benchmark
    public int sumArray() {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
            sum += array[i];
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```
In this example, the MyBenchmark class defines a benchmark method sumArray() that measures the time taken to sum the elements of an array. The @Setup annotation is used to set up the benchmark fixture before running the benchmark.

By using JMH, you can accurately measure and compare the performance of different code snippets or algorithms, helping you optimize your Java applications.

Switch expressions and the JMH microbenchmark suite introduced in Java 12 provide developers with improved language features for expressive code and powerful tools for benchmarking and performance analysis.
